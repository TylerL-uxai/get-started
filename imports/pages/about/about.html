<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  I've been programming html since I was in 5th grade. By the age of 23, I'd read almost all the books amazon had to offer on 'user experience.' I got jobs as a computer technician and full stack developer without needing a degree. From there I built a startup that attracted more sign ups than I could handle.
